# tvm_raspberrypi

[![Docker Image CI](https://github.com/abhilb/tvm_raspberrypi/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abhilb/tvm_raspberrypi/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Docker image to build Apache TVM python package for the Raspberry PI target. The docker image will clone the Apache TVM repo, build the C++ code and finally create the Apache TVM python package wheel file. Which can be recovered using directory mapping. 


@todo -> Create a docker compose file.
